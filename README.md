# Trash_can_with_senzor
Arduino project with ultrasonic sensor and servo motor.

The project includes two components connected to the Arduino UNO board. The bucket is made of cardboard. And on it we have a lid that needs to be opened when approaching the object. The task of proximity detection is performed by the sensor, and the servo motor is used for lifting.
